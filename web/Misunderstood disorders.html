                        <b><i>NOT what it is:</i></b><br><br> Those people who suffer schizophrenia are violently inclined. This is highly uncommon and typically connected to a different illness than schizophrenia.<br><br> It is an illness that necessitates
                        hospitalization. Since schizophrenia differs from person to person, hospitalization isn't always required.<br><br> You are many different people inside. Not multiple personalities, but psychosis is the focus of the condition.<br><br>                        It cannot be treated. It is possible to raise quality of life, despite the difficulty. Some people may be entirely cured of it.<br><br>

                        <b><i>How it works:</i></b><br><br> It is a psychotic condition that is frequently marked by hallucinations and/or delusions.<br><br> It is a mental disorder. Schizophrenia patients frequently think and behave strangely.<br><br>                        Additionally, it is a challenge to function. It can be challenging to carry out daily tasks if you have schizophrenia.<br><br> Schizophrenia is also complex. There are various forms of schizophrenia, including paranoid, catatonic,
                        disorganized, residual, and undifferentiated.<br><br> There is a great deal of misunderstanding about schizophrenia. Confusion over the true nature of the condition is caused by varying theories regarding its cause and symptoms.
                        Some people hold the mistaken belief that those who have the illness are less capable or that it is simply the result of poor parenting. In truth, there are a number of causes, including drug misuse, trauma, and occasionally genetics.
                        Fortunately, there are others with this condition who had achieved great success in the arts and in academic professions.</p><br>

In terms of DID, a lot of what is presented in movies is made up.<br><br> Comparable to schizophrenia Fundamental differences separate the two.<br><br>                        DID is a psychological condition. Contrary to popular belief, DID is not actually linked to personality.<br><br> It is obvious. Typically, it is very challenging to diagnose the disease.<br><br>

                        <b><i>How it works:</i></b><br><br> It is a dissociative illness used as a sham coping method for trauma.<br><br> At least two distinct mental states are markedly altered in behavior and memory.<br><br> DID is treatable. The majority
                        of the time, therapy entails coping mechanisms for the traumatic occurrences.<br><br> It's not uncommon for DID to be shown as a regular individual with a psychotic split personality. DID is frequently a reaction to traumatic events,
                        where the alteration in memory and behavior makes it unable to retrieve those memories. Changes and gaps in memory, self-identity, and conduct are frequent in those with the illness and seriously interfere with daily life.</p><br>
